			<h2>3. AI CHATBOT DISCLAIMER - NOT THERAPY OR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE</h2>

			<h3>3.1 Entertainment and Educational Purposes Only</h3>
			<div class="important">
				<p><strong>THE AI CHATBOT FEATURE ("AI FRIEND" OR "NOT THERAPY") IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. IT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL THERAPY, COUNSELING, MEDICAL ADVICE, OR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT.</strong></p>
			</div>
			<p>The AI chatbot is a conversational artificial intelligence tool designed to provide general relationship insights and discussion. It is <strong>NOT</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A licensed therapist, counselor, psychologist, or mental health professional</li>
				<li>A substitute for professional mental health care</li>
				<li>Qualified to diagnose, treat, or provide medical/psychological advice</li>
				<li>Designed for crisis intervention or emergency situations</li>
				<li>Capable of providing personalized professional advice for your specific situation</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>3.2 No Reliance on AI Content</h3>
			<p><strong>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, inappropriate, or harmful</li>
				<li>AI responses are generated by algorithms and do not constitute professional advice</li>
				<li>You should NOT rely on AI responses for important life decisions</li>
				<li>You should NOT use AI chat for mental health crises, suicidal thoughts, or emergency situations</li>
				<li>You assume ALL RISK and responsibility for any actions you take based on AI-generated content</li>
				<li>Stoke is NOT LIABLE for any harm, injury, or damages resulting from your use of or reliance on AI-generated content</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>3.3 Major Life Decisions</h3>
			<p><strong>DO NOT make major relationship decisions</strong> (such as breakups, divorce, marriage, or other significant life changes) based solely or primarily on AI-generated advice. The AI chatbot cannot understand the full context of your relationship and is not qualified to guide such decisions.</p>

			<h3>3.4 Mental Health and Crisis Resources</h3>
			<p><strong>IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, OR EMERGENCY:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Call 988</strong> (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) - Available 24/7 in the US</li>
				<li><strong>Call 911</strong> for immediate emergency assistance</li>
				<li><strong>Contact a licensed mental health professional</strong> or crisis counselor</li>
				<li><strong>Go to your nearest emergency room</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>DO NOT USE THE AI CHATBOT FOR CRISIS INTERVENTION.</strong> The AI is not equipped to handle mental health emergencies and cannot provide appropriate crisis support.</p>

			<h3>3.5 AI Limitations and Errors</h3>
			<p>You acknowledge that AI technology:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>May generate inappropriate, offensive, or harmful content</li>
				<li>May provide contradictory or inconsistent responses</li>
				<li>Cannot guarantee accuracy, safety, or appropriateness of content</li>
				<li>May malfunction, produce errors, or fail to respond appropriately</li>
				<li>Is constantly evolving and may behave unpredictably</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>STOKE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE</strong> for any content generated by the AI chatbot, and you use it entirely at your own risk.</p>

			<hr>
