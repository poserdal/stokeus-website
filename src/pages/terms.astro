			<h2>4. AI Chatbot Disclaimer - Not Therapy or Professional Advice</h2>

			<h3>4.1 Entertainment and Educational Purposes Only</h3>
			<div class="important">
				<p><strong>The AI chatbot feature ("AI Friend" or "Not Therapy") is for entertainment and educational purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional therapy, counseling, medical advice, or mental health treatment.</strong></p>
			</div>
			<p>The AI chatbot is a conversational artificial intelligence tool designed to provide general relationship insights and discussion. <strong>It is not:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A licensed therapist, counselor, psychologist, or mental health professional</li>
				<li>A substitute for professional mental health care</li>
				<li>Qualified to diagnose, treat, or provide medical/psychological advice</li>
				<li>Designed for crisis intervention or emergency situations</li>
				<li>Capable of providing personalized professional advice for your specific situation</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>4.2 No Reliance on AI Content</h3>
			<p><strong>You acknowledge and agree that:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, inappropriate, or harmful</li>
				<li>AI responses are generated by algorithms and do not constitute professional advice</li>
				<li><strong>You should not rely on AI responses for important life decisions</strong></li>
				<li><strong>You should not use AI chat for mental health crises, suicidal thoughts, or emergency situations</strong></li>
				<li>You assume all risk and responsibility for any actions you take based on AI-generated content</li>
				<li>Stoke is not liable for any harm, injury, or damages resulting from your use of or reliance on AI-generated content</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>4.3 Major Life Decisions</h3>
			<p><strong>Do not make major relationship decisions</strong> (such as breakups, divorce, marriage, or other significant life changes) based solely or primarily on AI-generated advice. The AI chatbot cannot understand the full context of your relationship and is not qualified to guide such decisions.</p>

			<h3>4.4 Mental Health and Crisis Resources</h3>
			<div class="important">
				<p><strong>If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, suicidal thoughts, or emergency:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Call 988</strong> (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) - Available 24/7 in the US</li>
					<li><strong>Call 911</strong> for immediate emergency assistance</li>
					<li><strong>Contact a licensed mental health professional</strong> or crisis counselor</li>
					<li><strong>Go to your nearest emergency room</strong></li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Do not use the AI chatbot for crisis intervention.</strong> The AI is not equipped to handle mental health emergencies and cannot provide appropriate crisis support.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>4.5 AI Limitations and Errors</h3>
			<p>You acknowledge that AI technology:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>May generate inappropriate, offensive, or harmful content</li>
				<li>May provide contradictory or inconsistent responses</li>
				<li>Cannot guarantee accuracy, safety, or appropriateness of content</li>
				<li>May malfunction, produce errors, or fail to respond appropriately</li>
				<li>Is constantly evolving and may behave unpredictably</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Stoke is not responsible</strong> for any content generated by the AI chatbot, and you use it entirely at your own risk.</p>

			<hr>
